                        <summary>How does the Kanjidon card system work?</summary>
                        <p>The cards are the core of Kanjidon: JLPT-themed packs (Kana, N5, N4, N3, N2, and even N1) each have 4 Kanjidon cards (6 for Premium users!). You need 30 Tama, the Kanjidon world’s coins, to open a pack. Open as many cards as you can and check out what they offer: each card has a meaning, an on reading, a kun reading, and an example sentence… everything you need to learn kanji the best way!</p>

                        <summary>What&#039;s the JLPT?</summary>
                        <p>The JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) is a test to check your Japanese skills. It’s split into five levels, from N5 (beginner) to N1 (advanced), and it’s used to certify your Japanese language abilities.<br><br>Kanjidon organizes cards by these levels, so you can study in a focused, structured way. If you’re starting from scratch, begin with the Kana packs: they only have hiragana and katakana, the two Japanese syllabic alphabets!</p>

                        <p>Cards range from 1 to 4 stars, with unique designs for each rarity. There are also super-rare golden cards and special two-star golden event variants, available only during specific periods. <br><br>With over 20 thematic types (Nature, Fire, Sky, etc.), each card is a work of art that keeps your Collection fresh and exciting.</p>

                        <p>Once you’ve opened packs, your cards go to the Collection, the perfect spot for studying and reviewing. Here, you can see all your cards and use the bottom-right button to filter by rarity, JLPT level, type, or opening date. <br><br>It’s your personal album, and you should use it for your study sessions.</p>

                        <summary>What are those dots on the cards?</summary>
                        <p>As you do Quizzes, kanji change status. They go from ‘new’ to ‘memorized’ if you answer correctly in Quizzes! If you get one wrong, it becomes ‘to review,’ and the algorithm will show it more often until you nail it. <br><br>The symbols on kanji are: N (new, just collected), M (memorized, if you got it right in Quizzes), R (to review, if you got it wrong once), and E (error, if you got it wrong twice in a row). Do lots of Quizzes and aim for all kanji to be M!</p>

                        <p>The little x2 or x3 symbol on cards in your Collection shows how many copies you have of that card. Yup, packs can give you duplicates, just like in real life! Good news: duplicates aren&#039;t useless—you can trade them for an Omikuji, a Japanese fortune oracle.</p>

Press it to add your personal notes about that kanji: mnemonic tricks, example sentences, or anything that helps you remember it better.<br><br>Your notes sync automatically across all your devices, so you can keep studying anywhere with your annotations always at hand!</p>

You&#039;ll see the cards you don&#039;t own are semi-transparent. Try tapping one! It&#039;ll start the trade process.</p>

                        <p>Each Quiz section has 10 questions, but every time you get one wrong, that kanji goes back in the queue and pops up again during the Quiz section. Kanjidon&#039;s powerful SRS algorithm tailors your Quiz sections based on your Collection, mistakes, and successes, making every session super effective. <br><br>A Quiz isn&#039;t a test—it&#039;s a challenge to grow and improve your skills.</p>

                        <p>Kanjidon uses the SM-2 algorithm, a scientifically validated spaced repetition system used by millions of students worldwide. It&#039;s based on decades of neuroscience research on how your brain forms memories.<br><br>Each kanji has its own score that adapts to your learning: if you answer correctly, it will be shown again after increasingly longer intervals. If you make a mistake, the interval shortens to help consolidate your memory.<br><br>This approach lets you review right before you forget, maximizing retention with the fewest repetitions possible.</p>
