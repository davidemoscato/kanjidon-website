                <p class="article-intro">12 months. 30 minutes a day. From absolute zero to reading manga, understanding anime without subtitles and passing JLPT N3. Does it seem impossible? It isn&#039;t, but you need a clear plan and the right tools. This roadmap tells you exactly what to do, month by month, without mincing words.</p>
<h2>Before You Start: The Rules</h2>
<ul><li>30 minutes a day, EVERY day. Not 3 hours on Sunday. The brain learns through consistency, not through marathons.</li><li>Don&#039;t skip the basics. If hiragana and katakana are not solid, everything else collapses.</li><li>A day lost is not a disaster. Two weeks lost yes. If you lose your rhythm, pick up again the next day without guilt.</li><li>Perfectionism kills progress. Don&#039;t wait to master a level 100% before moving on to the next. 80% is enough to move forward.</li><li>Measure progress. Take a mock test every month to see where you are. Kanjidon tracks your progress automatically.</li></ul>
<h2>Months 1-2: The Foundations (From Zero to N5 Base)</h2>
<h3>Weeks 1-2: Hiragana and Katakana</h3>
<p>The first step is to learn the two phonetic alphabets: hiragana (46 characters) and katakana (46 characters). Without these, you can&#039;t even get started. The good news: with the right method it only takes 2 weeks.</p>
<ul><li>Day 1-5: Basic hiragana (あ-ん), 10 characters per day with mnemonics</li><li>Day 6-7: complete hiragana review, first quizzes</li><li>Day 8-12: Basic katakana (ア-ン), 10 characters per day</li><li>Day 13-14: complete katakana + hiragana review together</li></ul>
<p>Kanjidon includes both hiragana and katakana with visual mnemonics and quizzes. You can complete both in 2 weeks with 15-20 minutes a day. The rest of the time use it to get started with basic grammar.</p>
<h3>Weeks 3-8: First 50 Kanji N5 + Basic Grammar</h3>
<p>With solid hiragana and katakana, it&#039;s time to enter the world of kanji. Start with 5 new kanji a day and study basic grammar at the same time.</p>
<ul><li>Kanji: 5 new ones per day with SRS (Kanjidon). At the end of month 2 you will have ~50 N5 kanji.</li><li>Grammar: Genki I chapters 1-5 or Tae Kim (introductory chapters). Basic particles (は, が, を, に, で), present conjugation.</li><li>Vocabulary: The words that contain the kanji you are learning. Don&#039;t study them in isolation.</li><li>Listening: Start with audio of Genki&#039;s lessons. Nothing else is needed for now.</li></ul>
<p>Milestone end of month 2: you can read hiragana and katakana without hesitation, recognize about 50 kanji, construct simple sentences (I eat sushi. She goes to school.).</p>
<h2>Months 3-4: Sprint N5 (The First Real Finish Line)</h2>
<p>These two months are dedicated to completing the N5 level. It is the first concrete goal and the basis of everything that comes after.</p>
<ul><li>Kanji: Complete all 103 N5 kanji. With 5 a day and the SRS review, you&#039;ll get there in these 8 weeks.</li><li>Grammar: Genki I completed (chapters 6-12). Past tense, te-form, expressions of desire.</li><li>Vocabulary: ~800 words (minimum for N5 and around 800).</li><li>Reading: Start with NHK Easy News. You won&#039;t understand everything, and that&#039;s normal.</li><li>Mock test: Do a JLPT N5 mock online at the end of month 4.</li></ul>
<p>Magic Moment: Around mid-month 3, you&#039;ll start to recognize kanji in real life — on Japanese restaurant menus, in anime subtitles, in product names. And the moment when Japanese stops being an incomprehensible wall and starts feeling like a language. On Kanjidon you can track exactly how many N5 kanji you&#039;ve learned, which ones you need to review, and how close you are to the finish line.</p>
<h2>Months 5-7: The Climb N4 (Basic Intermediate)</h2>
<p>With the N5 behind it, the N4 adds 181 new kanji (284 total) and significantly more complex grammar. This is where the game gets serious, but you already have the foundations.</p>
<ul><li>Kanji: 181 new N4 kanji. Maintain 5 new ones per day + review of old ones with SRS.</li><li>Grammar: Genki II complete. Passive, causative form, conditionals, basic keigo.</li><li>Vocabulary: ~1,500 total words.</li><li>Reading: move from graded readers to simple manga (Yotsuba&amp;! is perfect for this level).</li><li>Listening: slice-of-life anime with Japanese subtitles. Simple dramas.</li><li>Mock test: Do a JLPT N4 mock at the end of month 7.</li></ul>
<p>Kanjidon scales with you: When you move from N5 to N4, the SRS algorithm continues to review the N5 kanji as you add new N4s. You don&#039;t forget anything and you don&#039;t waste time reviewing what you already know. Adaptive quizzes become more challenging automatically.</p>
<h2>Months 8-10: Territory N3 (True Intermediate)</h2>
<p>N3 is the level that separates beginners from serious students. It adds 361 new kanji (645 total) and grammar that&#039;s starting to sound like real Japanese.</p>
<ul><li>Kanji: 361 new N3 kanji. Here 5 a day might be too much with the revision growing. 3-4 new ones a day is more realistic.</li><li>Grammar: Shin Kanzen Master N3 or Tobira. More nuanced grammatical points, formal expressions.</li><li>Vocabulary: ~3,000 total words. Start using vocabulary flashcards (Anki or similar).</li><li>Reading: simplified newspaper articles, light novels, middle-grade manga.</li><li>Listening: Japanese dramas, learner podcasts (like Nihongo with Teppei).</li><li>Writing: Start keeping a journal in Japanese. Even 3 sentences a day are enough.</li></ul>
<p>The biggest challenge at this level is the volume of kanji to review. With 645 active kanji, without an SRS you risk forgetting the ones you learned months ago. This is exactly where a system like Kanjidon becomes indispensable: the algorithm manages the revision of hundreds of kanji without you having to decide anything.</p>
<h2>Months 11-12: The Final Sprint</h2>
<p>The last two months are dedicated to specific preparation for the N3 exam (if you want to take it) or consolidation of skills.</p>
<ul><li>Weekly mock tests: simulate exam conditions (limited time, all three modules).</li><li>Gap analysis: identify your weak points. If reading kanji is the problem, step up the revision. If it&#039;s grammar, go back to Shin Kanzen Master.</li><li>Kanji: No new kanji. Only intensive review of the 645 already learned.</li><li>Intensive Listening: The listening section of the JLPT is where many students lose points. Practice purposefully.</li><li>Mock exam: at least 2 full mock tests in the last 2 weeks.</li></ul>
<h2>Resources Month by Month</h2>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table>
                <thead><tr><th>Period</th><th>Kanji</th><th>Grammar</th><th>Extra</th></tr></thead>
                <tbody><tr><td>Mesi 1-2</td><td>Kanjidon: kana + N5 base</td><td>Genki I (cap. 1-5) o Tae Kim</td><td>Audio Genki</td></tr><tr><td>Mesi 3-4</td><td>Kanjidon: N5 complete</td><td>Genki I completo (cap. 6-12)</td><td>NHK Easy News</td></tr><tr><td>Mesi 5-7</td><td>Kanjidon: N4 complete</td><td>Genki II complete</td><td>Simple manga, anime</td></tr><tr><td>Mesi 8-10</td><td>Kanjidon: N3</td><td>Tobira or Shin Kanzen N3</td><td>Drama, podcast, light novel</td></tr><tr><td>Mesi 11-12</td><td>Intensive review</td><td>Mock test + gap analysis</td><td>JLPT simulations</td></tr></tbody>
            </table></div>
<h2>Plan B: I Don&#039;t Have 30 Minutes in a Day</h2>
<p>Real life doesn&#039;t always allow for 30 minutes a day. If you can only dedicate 15 minutes or if there are weeks when you can&#039;t study, here&#039;s plan B:</p>
<ul><li>Same roadmap, times extended to 18 months instead of 12</li><li>Top priority: kanji + grammar. Cut listening and reading if necessary.</li><li>On impossible days, at least do the SRS review (5 minutes). Don&#039;t add new kanji, but don&#039;t lose old ones.</li><li>Concentrate your grammar sessions on the weekend when you have more time</li><li>Don&#039;t feel guilty: 18 months at a sustainable pace beats 12 months with burnout and abandonment</li></ul>
<h2>The 5 Mistakes That Slow Down Everyone</h2>
<ul><li>Study kanji without SRS. Copying them by hand without a review system is the slowest way to learn them. Use an algorithm: your brain and to understand, not to manage scheduling.</li><li>Ignore the kanji and just focus on the conversation. You can speak without kanji, but you can&#039;t read. And without reading, your Japanese remains limited forever.</li><li>Change apps/books every month. Choose your tools and stay with them. Consistency with a good method beats the excellent tool used 2 weeks.</li><li>Studying grammar without practicing it. Grammar is fixed through use, not through reading the rules. Write sentences, take quizzes, talk.</li><li>Compare your progress with others. Everyone has a different rhythm. The only useful comparison is with yourself from a month ago.</li></ul>
<h2>What Happens After N3?</h2>
<p>The N3 is the turning point. With 645 kanji, ~3,000 words, and solid intermediate grammar, you can:</p>
<ul><li>Read manga without a dictionary (for most genres)</li><li>Understanding anime and dramas at 60-70% without subtitles</li><li>Hold daily conversations</li><li>Read newspaper articles with some help</li><li>Working in Japanese companies in roles where N3 is the requirement (and common)</li></ul>
<p>From N3 onwards, learning naturally accelerates because you can learn from real context, not just from textbooks. Japanese stops being a subject and starts being a tool.</p>
<p>The first step is always the most difficult. Not the most complicated — the most difficult emotionally. Today you know zero Japanese. In 12 months you can be at a true intermediate level. The difference is made by one decision: to start. Kanjidon is free and covers the entire path from kana to N1. Download it, learn the first 5 hiragana today, and the countdown to N3 starts now.</p>
