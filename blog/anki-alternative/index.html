                <h1>Anki Is Powerful. But What If You Just Want to Learn Kanji?</h1>
                            </div>

            <div class="article-content">
                <p class="article-intro">Anki is legendary. It's free, open-source, and endlessly customizable. It's also a blank canvas that requires you to build (or hunt for) your own content. For kanji learning specifically, there might be a smoother path.</p>

                <h2>The Anki Paradox</h2>
                <p>Here's the thing about Anki: it's incredibly powerful precisely because it does nothing for you. No built-in content. No suggested study path. No hand-holding. For some learners, that's freedom. For others, it's a barrier.</p>
                <p>If you've ever spent an evening:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Searching for "the best" kanji deck (there are hundreds)</li>
                    <li>Tweaking interval settings you don't fully understand</li>
                    <li>Customizing card templates with HTML and CSS</li>
                    <li>Syncing issues between desktop and mobile</li>
                    <li>Staring at that 1990s interface wondering if there's a better way</li>
                </ul>
                <p>...then you know what we're talking about.</p>

                <h2>Anki's Real Strengths</h2>
                <p>Let's be fair. Anki earned its reputation for good reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Truly free</strong> &mdash; No subscriptions, no premium tiers (except iOS app)</li>
                    <li><strong>Universal</strong> &mdash; Works for any subject, any language</li>
                    <li><strong>Proven SRS</strong> &mdash; The spaced repetition algorithm is battle-tested</li>
                    <li><strong>Community decks</strong> &mdash; Thousands of shared decks available</li>
                    <li><strong>Total control</strong> &mdash; If you can imagine it, you can probably build it</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For medical students memorizing anatomy, law students tackling case law, or polyglots learning their fifth language, Anki's flexibility is unmatched.</p>
                <p>But for kanji specifically? There's an argument for purpose-built tools.</p>

                <h2>What Kanji Learners Actually Need</h2>
                <p>Kanji learning has specific requirements that generic flashcard apps don't address out of the box:</p>

                <h3>Structured Progression</h3>
                <p>The 2,136 j&#333;y&#333; kanji aren't random. There's a logical order&mdash;simpler characters that become components of complex ones. JLPT levels (N5 through N1) provide a proven framework. A kanji-specific app can guide this progression automatically.</p>

                <h3>Multiple Reading Types</h3>
                <p>Each kanji has on'yomi (Chinese readings) and kun'yomi (Japanese readings). Good kanji cards need to test both, in context. Building this in Anki requires careful deck design.</p>

                <h3>Visual Design Matters</h3>
                <p>Kanji are visual. The aesthetic presentation of characters affects how well you remember them. A card that displays kanji beautifully, with proper stroke order cues and visual hierarchy, beats a plain text card.</p>

                <h3>Motivation for the Long Haul</h3>
                <p>Learning 2,000+ kanji takes months, often years. You need more than an algorithm&mdash;you need reasons to open the app every day. Gamification isn't a gimmick; it's psychology working in your favor.</p>

                <h2>Kanjidon: SRS Without the Setup</h2>
                <p>We built Kanjidon for people who love what spaced repetition does but don't want to spend hours configuring it. Here's what's different:</p>

                <h3>Ready on Day One</h3>
                <p>Download, open, start learning. Every kanji from kana basics to JLPT N1 is already there&mdash;beautifully designed, properly organized, ready to go. No deck hunting. No configuration. No "am I using the right settings?" anxiety.</p>

                <h3>The Same Science, Better Delivered</h3>
                <p>Kanjidon uses the SM-2 algorithm&mdash;the exact same spaced repetition system that powers Anki, developed by Piotr Wozniak and validated by decades of cognitive science research. Your reviews are scheduled at optimal intervals based on your actual performance: answer correctly and the interval extends; struggle and it contracts to reinforce the memory before it fades.</p>
                <p>But here's where it gets smarter: during each session, if you answer incorrectly, that kanji immediately goes back into the queue. You'll see it again before the session ends. No waiting days to retry&mdash;you reinforce weak points in real-time while they're still fresh.</p>

                <h3>Cards You'll Actually Want to Collect</h3>
                <p>Every kanji is a collectible card with unique designs based on meaning and rarity. Open packs, build your collection, watch your progress become tangible. It sounds simple, but that sense of "collecting" makes a huge psychological difference.</p>

                <h3>8 Quiz Modes, Not Just Flashcards</h3>
                <p>Meaning recognition. Reading practice. Listening challenges. Multiple choice. Typed input. Each format engages different neural pathways, and that variety is scientifically proven to strengthen retention. No more autopilot reviews where you "recognize" cards without truly learning them.</p>
                <p>Filter quizzes by JLPT level&mdash;from N5 basics to N1 advanced&mdash;or focus purely on kana if you're building foundations. Can't decide what to study? The random quiz feature picks for you, ensuring you rotate through all formats for maximum benefit.</p>
                <p>Each session is 10 questions, but wrong answers cycle back into the queue. You don't move on until you've genuinely learned the material. It's not a test&mdash;it's training.</p>

                <h3>XP, Levels, and Visible Progress</h3>
                <p>Every correct answer earns experience points. Every perfect session (10/10) unlocks bonus rewards. Watch your cards evolve from "new" to "memorized" status as you master them. It sounds simple, but seeing tangible progress&mdash;not just a review count&mdash;changes how motivated you feel.</p>

                <h3>Battle Mode (Yes, Really)</h3>
                <p>Challenge friends or random opponents to real-time kanji battles. Answer faster and more accurately to win. Climb from E rank to S rank. It's the feature you didn't know you needed until you're defending your ranking at midnight.</p>

                <h3>Works Offline</h3>
                <p>Study on the subway, on a plane, anywhere. Your progress syncs when you're back online.</p>

                <h2>When to Stick with Anki</h2>
                <p>Anki is still the right choice if you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Study multiple subjects and want one tool for everything</li>
                    <li>Have specific deck requirements only custom cards can meet</li>
                    <li>Enjoy tinkering with settings and optimizing your system</li>
                    <li>Already have a working Anki setup you're happy with</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Don't fix what isn't broken. If Anki is working for you, keep going.</p>

                <h2>When Kanjidon Makes More Sense</h2>
                <p>Consider switching (or starting fresh) if you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Want to learn kanji without becoming an Anki expert first</li>
                    <li>Prefer mobile-first apps with modern design</li>
                    <li>Get motivated by game mechanics and visual progress</li>
                    <li>Value time saved on setup over total customization</li>
                    <li>Haven't started yet and want the smoothest possible beginning</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                <p>Anki is a powerful, free tool that can do almost anything&mdash;if you put in the work to make it happen. Kanjidon is a focused, polished experience designed specifically for kanji, ready to work the moment you download it.</p>
                <p>Both use proven spaced repetition. Both can get you to JLPT N1. The question is: do you want to build your learning system, or do you want to start learning?</p>
